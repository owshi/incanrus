                    <p>Hello and welcome to Interstudy Canrus! Here we have an internationally experienced team that can help you with all your challenges when making that life changing leap to study abroad. A little bit about myself, I grew up in a small town in northern Alberta, Canada. I first had the opportunity to enhance my study experience through an international exchange in my thrid year of University to Belgium. This changed everything. I couldnt get enough of the unique and real life experiences I was gaining out of these programs. After completing an internship in Malaysia as a Bond Analyst, I finished my Bachlors of Management Degree from the University of Lethbridge in Canada. Shortly thereafter, I decided to persue a Masters Degree but I wanted something unique. I completed my MA from the University of Applied Sciences in Schmalkalden, Germany and through this program completed an MBA where I graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, Texas, USA. I have always been tutoring friends and with odd jobs in university as a tutor lecturing and as a teaching assistant I gained a passion for education. I feel I have always been a teacher at heart and with this I started my teaching as an Economics and
                    </p>
                    <p>Finance Professor at a joint Canadian-Chinese University in Changchun, China. The Asian teaching experience is like none other, and I formed great friendships and relationships with the local and international teachers alike. It was however, interacting with the students that I enjoyed most, as it only felt like yesterday that I was in the same position that they were. After China, life took me to Central America where I was Director of Language Programs for an Educational Language institution that also organized Volunteer Programs tailored for International Volunteers. It was after this quick 10 years of my life that we decided to dedicate ourselves to help people discover the endless adverture that is international education. I have studied over 5 languages in my life and thrive in international settings. I hope I can help you do the same and persue your goals! ​Morgan Bell </p>
