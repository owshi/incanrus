                        <p>About the company Incanrus I discovered quite by accident, through my friend who for several years lived in Canada. In my plans have long been an issue about getting education abroad. I didn’t know where to start, could not decide which country to go to, what school to choose which generally demands. I was lucky that I ended up in the hands of professionals who helped me to make the right choice, execute all necessary documents and obtain a visa and leave. Like any person departing to another country without knowing anything about the school, residence and generally how life in a foreign land I had certain fears and doubts. But I am very happy with the result of the command Incanrus. I arrived at all ready. I met my Canadian family that helped me overcome the culture shock and introduced me to the culture of Canada. Now I am studying at the language school IH Vancouver. In my opinion the school meets the highest standards. Good location, friendly staff, excellent qualified international student group, new equipment. For half a year in Vancouver, I can’t believe how quickly I learned English, how many saw and learned. Canada is a wonderful country and I am glad that I finally ended up here. In the school I left to study another six months, after which I plan to go to College. Want to say a huge thanks to Incanrus for for supporting the implementation of my plans.

                        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Roman. I want to express my enormous gratitude to team Incanrus for the help in moving to Canada. A year ago I decided to move with my family from Israel. I was thinking about such countries as United States, Canada and Australia. With the representative of the company Incanrus Elena, I met by chance on the Internet. At that time, immigration to another country was for me something is not real. But Elena dispel my doubts. Half a year of hard training and I ended up on studies in Canada in the province of Alberta. We had to urgently leave Israel. Elena has helped me come to study in College (in the future I plan to find a job in one of the oil companies of the province), helped my wife to enter a language course, she picked up a home and school for children. We were very pleased that we came and we had everything there. We would’ve failed because of not very good knowledge of the language and knowledge of the city. I want to wish all the best Incanrus company and thanks again.

                        <p>Hello, my name is Alina. A week ago I came back from winter break which I spent in Mexico. All impressions are not simply to describe. On this trip I decided to combine study with vacations. I spent the morning in class, not necessarily in the classroom, often we were outdoors, on the beach. The study was not a burden. After lunch, I had a lot of free time. I went for salsa lessons, shopping, partying and all this organized school IH Riviera Maya. Great food, friendly people, magnificent Beach, excellent accommodation, new friends-all this was my short week-long fairy tale!!! For the summer I have in plans Spain so expect me again. Best wishes to Incanrus!!!
